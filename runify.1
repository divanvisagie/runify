.\" Manpage for runify
.TH man 1 "30 April 2018" "0.0.4" "runify man page"
.SH NAME
runify - convert latin alphabet characters to Elder Futhark runes
.SH SYNOPSIS
cat [FILE] | runify
ifconfig | runify
.SH DESCRIPTION
runify is designed to have data piped through it, it currently does
not receive files itself but there are plans in the future for it to do so.

When runify runs into characters that are not inherently part of the Elder Futhark
it will make the decision as to how to most appropriately replace the character.

For example: "x" becomes "ᚲᛋ" because it sounds like cs or ks
