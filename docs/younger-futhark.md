# Younger Futhark

The Younger Futhark is a reduced form of the Elder Futhark, used by Scandinavian peoples from the 9th to 11th century CE. It consists of 16 runes, reflecting sound changes in the Old Norse language.

## Historical Context

- **Period**: ~800 CE to ~1100 CE (Viking Age)
- **Rune count**: 16 runes (reduced from 24)
- **Region**: Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden)
- **Variants**: Long-branch (Danish) and Short-twig (Swedish-Norwegian)

The reduction from 24 to 16 runes occurred paradoxically as the language developed more sounds. This means many Younger Futhark runes represent multiple phonemes.
